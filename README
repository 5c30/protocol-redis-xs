NAME
    Protocol::Redis::XS - hiredis based parser compatible with
    Protocol::Redis

SYNOPSIS
      use Protocol::Redis::XS;
      my $redis = Protocol::Redis::XS->new;
      $redis->parse("+OK\r\n");
      $redis->get_message;

DESCRIPTION
    This provides a fast parser for the Redis protocol using the code from
    <http://github.com/antirez/hiredis|hiredis> and with API compatibility
    with Protocol::Redis.

    This is a low level parsing module, you probably want to look at the
    modules mentioned in "SEE ALSO" first.

METHODS
    As per Protocol::Redis.

  parse($string)
    Parse a chunk of data (calls "on_message" callback if defined and a
    complete message is received).

  get_message
    Return a message. This is a potentially nested data structure, for
    example as follows:

      {
        type => '*',
        data => [
          {
            type => '$',
            data => 'hello'
          }
        ]
      }

  on_message
    Set callback for "parse".
